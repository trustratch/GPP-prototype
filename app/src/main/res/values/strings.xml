        "Int. J. Network Security, 7(2):273â€“292, 2008.\n\n"

        "   Inspired by an old Chinese game, Go, we have designed a new graphical password scheme, Pass-Go, in which a user selects intersections on a grid as a way to input a password."
        "While offering an extremely large full password space (256 bits for the most basic scheme), \n"
        "our scheme provides acceptable usability, as empirically demonstrated by, to the best of our knowledge, the largest user study (167 subjects involved) on graphical passwords,"
        "conducted in the fall semester of 2005 in two university classes.\n\n"
        "   Our scheme supports most application environments and input devices, rather than being limited to small mobile devices (PDAs), and can be used to derive cryptographic keys."

        "We study the memorable password space and show the potential power of this scheme by exploring further improvements and variation mechanisms.\n\n"
